# MyBankingSystem
Banking System supported with payment application.

The “Ease In Banking “ project is a model Internet Banking Site. Primary aim of this project is to provide basic information how to use ATM machine and Online transaction app. This project enables the customers to perform the basic banking transactions by sitting at their office or at homes through PC or laptop. The system provides the access to the customer to create an account, deposit/withdraw the cash from his account, also to view reports of all accounts present.. Thus today's banking is no longer confined to branches. E-banking facilitates banking transactions by customers round the clock globally. The primary aim of this to provide an improved design methodology, which envisages the future expansion, and modification, which is necessary for a core sector like banking. This necessitates the design to be expandable and modifiable and so a modular approach is used in developing the application software.
